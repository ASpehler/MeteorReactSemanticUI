## Summary

I am using this Boilerplate for most projects I want to start with Meteor. It is in his purest form, but this is the perfect starter to prototype a beautiful looking website rapidly when you do not need authentication.

## The Boilerplate

- Meteor
- React 16
- React Router 4
- Semantic UI React

## Installation & Deployment

### Meteor

```sh
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ASpehler/MeteorReactSemanticUI.git
cd MeteorReactSemanticUI/
yarn install
```

### Start the project

```sh
npm start
```

The app is now running on http://localhost:3000/
